An Internet Time Warp

Steam, in its current form, is hardly recognisable when compared to early releases. However, you may be surprised to learn that, despite innumerable changes made to Steam in its 17-year lifespan, its Graphical User Interface system, VGUI (which is built into the Source engine), has remained virtually unchanged. This has allowed me to create a skin which very accurately replicates the look and feel of the Steam client from around 2004. I have future-proofed this skin to the best of my ability by including as few files as possible (and, therefore, fewer points of failure). Ostensibly, Valve has plans to re-write the Steam client in JavaScript; we have already seen several moves in this direction. Until such time, welcome to 2004.

This version includes fixes for the latest version of the Steam client (**Last Updated 2021-05-07**).

Installing

**Note: This skin has not been tested on Linux or MacOS**

* Copy **OG-Steam** into `Steam/skins`
* Select the new skin through `Settings/Interface`
* Disable font smoothing in both Steam and Windows for a retro look (not recommended for everyday use).
