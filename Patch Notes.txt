v1.0

This is the first official release of OG-Steam.
This means I am happy enough with the project's current
state to give it the "1.0". I didn't bother with versions
for the "beta" because there were too many minor changes
to track (and I'm lazy). From now on, all updates will be
released with a version number. At this point, most, if
not all visual inconsistencies have been rectified, and
most, if not all unnecessary files have been trimmed.
Future versions should be maintenance patches to fix
problems caused by newer versions of Steam.
